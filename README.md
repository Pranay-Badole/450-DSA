# 450-DSA

* This repository contains some very important and challenging problems from Love Babbar [450 DSA Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FMdN_OCfOI0iAeDlqswCiC2DZzD4nPsb/view).
* These are some problems, but not all, that I would personally consider revisiting specially before an interview.

* Here is how I have solved the sheet [My Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jXgWhn99gcgGfXAZjmpVw2JwovW_JdLp/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103364936010181617084&rtpof=true&sd=true) and i would recommend to solve in a similar way taking notes of things like:
  * tricks you came up with and find it useful
  * new algos that were unknown to you
  * why were you getting an error on a problem and how you resolved it
  
* Because believe me you will eventually forget it for sure but making notes will allow you to revisit it quickly and efficiently.
